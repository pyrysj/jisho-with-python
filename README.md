# jisho-with-python

(Unlike the name suggests), this does not deal with jisho and python. This was an initial idea, but I found out that it was unfeasible. Inspired by an (older) piece of software, and some forum discussions regarding the subject, and the software previously mentioned using an older format of dictionaries, I decided to make this (quick) script to match words from a provided dictionary (JMDICT) with a list of words provided by the user. It works relatively well, however there are a number of potential tweaks that could be made, and will possibly be worked on. With one of the main ones being handling multiple matches. This is still a very early version. The code may not work. I do not make any guarantees that this works.

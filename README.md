# jisho-with-python

(Unlike the name suggests), this does not deal with jisho and python.  This was an initial idea, but I found out that it was unfeasible. Inspired by an (older) piece of software, and some forum discussions regarding the subject, and the software previously mentioned using an older format of dictionaries, I decided to make this (quick) script to match words from a provided dictionary (JMDICT) with a list of words provided by the user.
